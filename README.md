## Future Development üöÄ 

This project has a lot of potential for growth. Here are some ideas for future features:

- **Multi-API Support**: Integrate other translation services like DeepL or Microsoft Translator and allow users to choose.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Add a "listen" button to speak the selected or translated text aloud.
- **Translation History**: Keep a history of recent translations in the popup for easy access.
- **Advanced Customization**: Allow users to customize the appearance of the translation bubble (colors, font size, position) from the Options page.
- **Definition Mode**: Add an option to get a dictionary definition of a word instead of just a translation.
- **Publish to Web Store**: Package the extension for easy installation from the Chrome Web Store.
